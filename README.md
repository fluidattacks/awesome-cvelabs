# awesome-cvelabs

A list of all awesome CVELabs

## Criteria

An awesome CVELabs is an independent team that:

* Finds vulnerabilities without profiting economically (excludes bounty programs)
* Is not a hub CNA (like [Zero Day Initiative](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/))
* Is not a vendor CNAs (vendors that index CVEs of his own products)
* Researchers that found CVEs work on the team

## Hall of fame

* Quantity: Source Incite
* Productiviy: Source Incite
* Activity (oposite to Inactivity): Synaktiv
* Diversity (oposite to Concentration): Cipher Labs
* Oldest: Withsecure

## Columns

* Months: Last CVE - First CVE
* Productivity: Total CVE / Months (CVE per month)
* Vendors: Unique vendors over CVE 
* Concentration: Total CVE / Vendors (CVE per vendor)
* Researchers: Unique vendors over CVE
* Inactivity: Today - Last CVE (months since last CVE)

## Labs

Descendent order acording to CVE column:
