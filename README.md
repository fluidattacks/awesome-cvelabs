# awesome-cvelabs

A list of all awesome CVELabs

## Criteria

An awesome CVELabs is an independent team that:

* Finds vulnerabilities without profiting economically (excludes bounty programs)
* Is not a hub CNA (like [Zero Day Initiative](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/))
* Is not a vendor CNAs (vendors that index CVEs of his own products)
* Researchers that found CVEs work on the team

## Hall of fame

* Quantity: FortiGuard
* Productiviy: FortiGuard
* Activity (oposite to Inactivity, with the most recent "Last" parameter): NCC Group
* Diversity (oposite to Concentration, with the oldest "First" parameter): Synacktiv
* Oldest: Sec Consult
* Fertility: Positive Technologies

## Columns

* (A)dvisories: Total Advisores
* (Q)uantity: Total CVEs
* (M)onths: Last CVE - First CVE
* (P)roductivity: Total CVE / Months (CVE per month)
* (V)endors: Unique vendors over CVE
* (C)oncentration: Total CVE / Vendors (CVE per vendor)
* (I)nactivity: Today - Last CVE (months since last CVE)
* (R)esearchers: Unique researchers over CVE
* (F)ertility: Total CVE / Researchers
